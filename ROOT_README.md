# Enhancing REST API Testing with NLP Techniques

Within this repository you will find the necessary components to run NLP2REST, our approach to automatically enhance OpenAPI specifications with rules (e.g, constraints and example values) extracted from natural language description fields.

## 1. Run target REST API(s)
The approach has to be run on one or more target REST APIs. The APIs must be reachable at the URL specified in the OpenAPI specification of the service.

## 2. Deploy the Rule Extractor service
The docker build -t ruleextractor .Rule Extractor service is a python application (reachable through a REST API) capable of extracting OpenAPI formal rules (e.g., constraints and example values) from natural language. To run the Rule Extractor please follow the instructions in the `rule_extractor` directory of this repository. In short, you will have to:
- get a model (either by training it, or by downloading the pre-trained model from the Google Drive link in the README file);
- build and run the python application (we provide a `Dockerfile` to quickly deploy the service, but instructions are also available to install the service on your system)
- the service is expected to run in the `localhost` on port `4000`, i.e., [http://localhost:4000/]()

## 3. Run the Rule Validator (custom strategy of RestTestGen)
The Rule Validator is a custom strategy built on top of RestTestGen framework, available in the `rule_validator` directory, that will:
1. parse the OpenAPI specification of the selected API (you need to provide the path to the specification in the configuration file of RestTestGen);
2. call the Rule Extractor service to extract rules from natural language descriptions;
3. interact with the target API to validate the extracted rules.

Please follow the instructions in the RestTestGen README.md file in the `rule_validator` directory to set up and run RestTestGen with the rule validation strategy.

The output of RestTestGen will be available in directory named `output`, and, specifically, in a subfolder of this directory named with the same name of the input specification, concatenated with a timestamp (e.g., `output/fdic-202305251554443`). This folder will contain the enhanced OpenAPI specification and reports of the HTTP interactions generated by the Rule Validator.

## 4. Experiment replication
